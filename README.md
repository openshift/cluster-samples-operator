# Overview

The samples operator manages the sample imagestreams and templates stored in the openshift namespace, and any docker credentials, stored as a secret, needed for the imagestreams to import the images they reference.

On initial startup, the operator will create the default samples resource to initiate the creation of the imagestreams and templates.  The imagestreams are the RHEL based OCP imagestreams pointing to images on `registry.redhat.io`.  Similarly the templates are those categorized as OCP templates.  When details for obtaining the credentials for registry.redhat.io are finalized, we will begin defaulting to that registry for the imagestreams.

The samples operator, along with it's configuration resources, are contained within the openshift-cluster-samples-operator namespace.  With releases before 4.5, the samples operator would copy the install pull secret into the `openshift`
namespace to facilitate API Server's imagestream import from `registry.redhat.io`.  Starting with 4.5 that is no longer required, as the API Server's imagestream import can access the install pull secret for imagestreams in any namespace.  
Otherwise, an admin can create any additional secret(s) in the openshift namespace as needed (where those secrets contain the content of a docker config.json) needed to facilitate image import, if say they override the registry to something
other than `registry.redhat.io`.

The image for the samples operator contains imagestream and template definitions for the associated OpenShift release. Each sample includes an annotation that denotes the OpenShift version that it is compatible with. The operator uses this annotation to ensure that each sample matches it's release version. Samples outside of its inventory are ignored, as are skipped samples (see below). Modifications to any samples that are managed by the operator will be reverted automatically.  The jenkins images are actually part of the image payload from the install and are tagged into the image streams in question directly.



The samples resource includes a finalizer which will clean up the following upon its deletion:

- Operator managed imagestreams
- Operator managed templates
- Operator generated configuration resources
- Cluster status resources


Upon deletion of the samples resource, the samples operator will recreate the resource using the default configuration.

# Configuration

The samples resource offers the following configuration fields:

- ManagementState
    - Managed: the operator will update the samples as the configuration dictates
    - Unmanaged: the operator will ignore updates to the samples resource object and any imagestreams or templates in the openshift namespace
    - Removed: the operator will remove the set of managed imagestreams and templates in the openshift namespace. It will ignore new samples created by the cluster admin or any samples in the skipped lists.  After the removals are complete, the operator will work like it is in the 'Unmanaged' state and ignore any watch events on the sample resources, imagestreams, or templates.  There are some caveats around concurrent creates and removal (see Config behaviors section).
- Samples Registry: Override the registry that images are imported from
- Architecture:  The currently supported values are x86_64, amd64, arm64, ppc64le, s390x.  This field was originally made an 
  array during the early, pre-release days of 4.x because the possibility of installing multiple archtiectures was being considered. However, that has never come to fruition, 
  nor is it likely to come to fruition.  Instead, the operator looks at Go's `runtime.GOARCH` package / variable at its initial startup to determine which
  architecture's set of sample imagestreams and templates to install.  And you are not allowed to change it after that.
- Skipped Imagestreams:  Imagestreams that are in the operator’s inventory, but that the cluster admin wants the operator to ignore / not manage
- Skipped Templates:  Templates that are in the operator’s inventory, but that the cluster admin wants the operator to ignore / not manage

## Config restrictions

You cannot change the Architecture field at this time.

## Config behaviors

- Neither deletion nor setting the ManagementState to Removed will be complete while imagestream imports are still in progress.  Once progress has completed (either in success or in error), then delete/remove will commence.  Details on progress tracking can be found in the Conditions section.
- imagestream/template watch events are ignored once deletion or removal has started
- imagestream and templates watch events can come in before the initial samples resource object is created … the operator will detect and requeue the event

# Conditions

The samples resource maintains the following conditions in its status:

- SamplesExists: Indicates the samples have been created in the openshift namespace
- ImageChangesInProgress:
    - This condition is deprecated as of the 4.7 branch of this repository.  `ImageStream` image imports are no longer tracked in real time via conditions on the samples config resource, nor do in progress `ImageStreams` directly affect updates to the `ClusterOperator` instance `openshift-samples`.  Prolonged errors with `ImageStreams` are reported now by Prometheus alerts. 
    - Also, the list of pending imagestreams will be represented by a configmap for each imagestream in the samples operator's namespace (where the imagestream name is the configmap name).  When the imagestream has completed imports, the respective configmap for the imagestream is deleted.
- ImportCredentialsExist: Credentials for pulling from `registry.redhat.io` exist in the `pull-secret` Secret in the `openshift-config` namespace ... i.e. the install pull secret
- ConfigurationValid: True or false based on whether any of the restricted changes noted above have been submitted
- RemovePending: Indicator that we have a management state removed setting pending, resulting in deletion of all the resources the operator manages.  Note that deletions do not start while are waiting for any in progress imagestreams to complete.  This is set to true just prior to executing the deletions, and set to false when the deletions are completed.  The associated ClusterOperator object for the Samples Operator will have its Progressing condition set to `true` when this Condition is `true` (though typically the deletions occur fairly quickly).
- ImportImageErrorsExist:
    - Indicator of which imagestreams had errors during the image import phase for one of their tags
    - True when an error has occurred
    - The configmap associated with the imagestream will remain in the samples operator's namespace.  There will be a key in the configmap's data map for each imagestreamtag, where the value of the entry will be the error message reported in the imagestream status.
- MigrationInProgress: This condition is deprecated as of the 4.7 branch of this repository.  Upgrade tracking is now achieved via the other conditions and both the per imagestream configmaps and the imagestream-to-image configmap. 

# CVO Cluster Operator Status

- Available
- Failing
- Progressing

See https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/docs/dev/clusteroperator.md#conditions for how these
Cluster Operator status conditions are managed.

# Disconnected mirroring assistance

A `ConfigMap` named `imagestreamtag-to-image` is created in the Samples Operator's namespace that contains an
entry for each `ImageStreamTag`, where the value of the entry is the image used to populate that `ImageStreamTag`.

The format of the key for each entry in the `data` field in the `ConfigMap` is `<imagestreamname>_<imagestreamtagname>`.

Samples Operator will come up as `Removed` for a disconnected OCP install.  If you choose to change it to `Managed`,
override the registry to a mirror registry available in your disconnected environment, you can use this `ConfigMap`
as a reference for which images need to be mirrored for your `ImageStreams` of interest to properly import.

# IPv6

Samples Operator will bootstrap as `Removed` if it detects it is running on ipv6, since at last check, `registry.redhat.io`
does not support ipv6.

# Troubleshooting

CRD instance for the samples operator config:  `oc get configs.samples.operator.openshift.io cluster -o yaml`

You can also use `configs.samples` for short.

Check the status of the conditions. (See above for details on those conditions)

While imagestream import failures no longer affect the state Samples reports to the CVO (that changes occurred in 4.6),
the samples operator will fire Prometheus alerts per the rules defined in [https://github.com/openshift/cluster-samples-operator/blob/master/manifests/010-prometheus-rules.yaml](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-samples-operator/blob/master/manifests/010-prometheus-rules.yaml)

The samples operator will also attempt to re-import the imagestreams on approximate 15 minute intervals.  Otherwise,
a cluster admin can:

- Retry the import whenever they like via `oc import-image <imagestream name> -n openshift --all`; if successful, the operator will detect the success and clear that imagestream from the failure list
- Add the failing imagestream(s) to the `skippedImagestreams` list; the operator will also clear the imagestream(s) specified from the failure list

Deployment, Events in operator’s namespace (openshift-cluster-samples-operator):  basic `oc get pods`, `oc get events`, `oc logs` of the operator pod 

If any configmaps persist in the samples operator's namespace, the data maps for those configmaps will have information on which 
import failed:  `oc get configmaps -n openshift-cluster-samples-operator -o yaml`

Samples: `oc get is -n openshift`, `oc get templates -n openshift`  … use of -o yaml on any given imagestream should show the status, and import errors will be noted there as well

Deletion of the CRD instance will reset the samples operator to the default configuration, but leave the current revision of the samples operator pod running.

You can also set the management state of the samples operator to `Removed` if you do not need samples running in your
cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: samples.operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  architectures:
  - x86_64
  managementState: Removed
```

# "In-payload" imagestreams 

The imagestreams defined at (https://github.com/openshift/cluster-samples-operator/blob/master/manifests/08-openshift-imagestreams.yaml)[https://github.com/openshift/cluster-samples-operator/blob/master/manifests/08-openshift-imagestreams.yaml]
are not managed by the samples operator.  These are special imagestreams that point to images in the install payload, and their creation and updates are handled by the 
[Cluster Version Operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator)

# Development

NOTE:  this next step violates your cluster support contract if you are an OCP customer.  But if your are using a cluster
for development, and you wish to experiment with and update the samples operator code itself, you can reset the image used
for the samples operator via the following steps:

- Run `oc edit clusterversion version` and add an override entry to the spec for the Deployment of the samples operator so it is unmanaged:

```yaml
spec:
  overrides:
  - kind: Deployment
    group: apps/v1
    name: cluster-samples-operator
    namespace: openshift-cluster-samples-operator
    unmanaged: true
```

- Scale down the deployment via `oc scale deploy cluster-samples-operator --replicas=0`
- Edit the samples resource, `oc edit config.samples cluster`, remove the finalizer
- Delete the samples resource, `oc delete config.samples cluster`, config map/secrets in operator namespace, imagestreams and templates in openshift namespace
- Scale up the deployment via `oc scale deploy cluster-samples-operator --replicas=1`
